# Haskell Foundation Volunteering

The [Matchmaker](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/matchmaker) project will be an easy to use way to coordinate volunteers with open source maintainers. Until it is ready, please use this repository to coordinate.

Here are the steps:

## Volunteers

1. Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/volunteering/issues)
2. Choose the "üñê Volunteer Available" issue template and fill in the form.
3. Look through the [Projects list](projects.md) and add comments to any Issues for the project opportunities that look interesting.
4. If you find a good match, close the issue with a PR that adds you in the [Volunteers list](volunteers.md).
5. If you are unable to find a match and no longer want to be contacted, close the issue.

## Project Maintainers

1. Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/volunteering/issues)
2. Choose the "üéÅ Project Opportunity" issue template and fill in the form.
3. Add an entry to the [Projects list](projects.md) table.
4. Look through the [Volunteers list](volunteers.md) and comment on the Issues for interested volunteers who might be a good fit.
5. If you find a good match, or no longer need the hep, close the issue with a PR that removes that opportunity from the list.

## Mentorship / Code Reviewers

Would you like a Haskell mentor, or someone to occasionally provide a code review to help you improve?

Are you willing to do that for others?

You can set the boundaries of your commitment, giving back to the community and helping people learn faster!

1. Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/volunteering/issues)
2. Choose the "Mentor/Reviewer" issue template and fill in the form.
3. Add an entry to the [Mentors list](mentors.md) table.
4. Talk to people in the Issue to find one or more mentees with a mutual fit.
5. Once you have the mentee(s) you are able to work with, close the issue.

## Speaker Bureau

Are you interested in giving talks to User Groups and other organizations?

Add an entry to the [Speakers List](speakers.md) table!

If you are organizing an event, you can contact the speaker directly (if they have provided contact information), or contact the HF and we will reach out for you. Being on this list does not require that any given speaker will agree, but rather gives a good starting point for organizers to source speakers, experienced and new, who are open to it!

## This Repository

We welcome PRs to improve this process as well.
